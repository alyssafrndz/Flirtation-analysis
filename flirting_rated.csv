0,"Exactly! I think if I were to do college again I’d try some more creative stuff tho, some of the work I see Some people do is so cool"
0,Ah I feel that. I can go for quite some time but that bit of alone time is so crucial haha

0,"Okay! What's your field? Could it be toxicology. I hope not 🥲💩. 

I'm working full time. No concrete plans to go back to school for a while. Working at a Service Desk for an insurance company"
0,That's really cool and interesting!
0,I hope too. I'm sure it's exactly that down the line.
0,How was your day?
0,That sounds wonderful! I can relate to the parts about sleep and being tired afterwards. Proof that your brain was utilized for something new!
0,"My day was very regular and kinda boring. Just a day at work, talking quite a bit with my colleague. Not much to do at work, not many users coming by."
0,Need to get a new job i feel like
0,Yeah it is. But very stimulating now that I've been at it for over 18 months. 😁👴
0,Damn corona. It could've been worse though. Need to remember to be grateful.
0,Haha. Yeah. I was tired today too but out of boredom.
0,When are you going to bed then? ☺️
1,"Yeah. I know how hard the lockdown is in germany. Maybe we could go to a cafe together some day?

Good night ☺️☺️"
0,Yeah. How was your day btw? 😁
0,"Haha. Can relate. Well, sleep is lot something to play around with I say. It makes a world of difference."
0,"Slept pretty okay myself. Jogged on the treadmill yesterday so that's probably why. 

How did you sleep? 👴😁"
0,Oh no. What's do you think is going on with your sleep?
0,"I had a pretty good day yesterday. Talked quite a bit with my colleague about life and relationships. It made the time fly by really quickly. Finished the day with watching Peaky Blinders. That show is really good!

How about you? ☺️"
0,Drinking lemon water is usually a dealbreaker for me

0,thats the worst
0,cant even think about it without gagging
0,sure is haha
0,how is your weekend going?
0,"Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. ""What the devil?"" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, ""Tally ho lads"" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended."
0,"You may not believe me, but I am respecting you right now, as we speak."
0,"Oh no, what sorts of messages are you getting?"
0,I've always wondered what its like to be a woman on tinder
0,"I see, at least its transparent haha"
0,How has your week been?
0,rip I do not miss finals one bit
0,what are you studying
0,Fuck yeah I'll go on frequent trips to goodwill with you
0,Whats the coolest thing you've ever gotten there?
0,"Electrical engineering and computer science at Berkeley, and then all those hobbies. How do you find the time?"
0,I feel that haha. Do you not like coding at all or are classes just enough for you?
1,"Hey Alexandra, I appreciate the super like :)"
0,How has your weekend been?
0,If this is a reference to whether I cook good spaghetti that answer is yes
0,Do u want to know the secret
0,Of course I do
0,The secret is a full stick of butter
0,Nobody can guess what you put in the spaghetti but they know its good
0,Exactly. For someone with no talent its allowed me to make pretty good food
0,How has your week been?
0,19 and already an attorney at such a prestigious law firm?
0,I'm impressed
0,I aspire to break into the industry some day
0,How is your week going?
0,It's not too bad - I have work every day this week but Thursday which isnt the best but my family is on the east coast anyway so it doesnt matter much
0,You have any plans for thanksgiving?
0,Arent you supposed to be legally representing chickens not eating them?
0,Due to dietary restrictions I can eat like nothing traditional for Thanksgiving haha so your boy will be making spaghetti
0,Oh man. celiac?
0,"I stay away from gluten, all animal products except ground beef"
0,Mostly stay away from soy
0,I went vegan for ethical reasons. Cows (especially pasture raised) live substantially better lives than other animals and produce far more meat per animal so I am reasonably comfortable eating it (the alternative is that they dont live at all). My health was pretty bad for a bit so I decided to try introducing some kind of meat and beef was the best option. Dont know if it helped or not
0,Only ground because it's cheap hahaha
0,I suspect the same thing with me regarding gluten. I tested negative for celiac but get really fatigurd when I eat bread
1,Halle how is your life going rn -10 to 10 hit me w it
1,Is it a dealbreaker that I cant whistle
0,Salutations comrade
1,Melanie you are absolutely killing it with the hats
0,How is ur life going right now 1 to 10
0,You have a very specific type
0,"I have daddy issues, still working on the alcoholism though"
0,Okay I respect the white claw helmet but tbh I have always thought truly tastes better
0,I will trade you one video of my dog trying to eat a piece of cucumber out of my hand in exchange for two pictures of your cat. Willing to negotiate
0,Or if you want to be safe you can send me 1 cat picture before and then hold out the last one til after I send the video
0,Combination of too much free time and the perfect opportunity
1,"Hey Ella, you have a great smile!"
0,How is ur life going right now 1 to 10 hit me w it
0,I would say 5 as well. I am pretty happy about the election and like it a lot in CA (just moved here). But obviously life is pretty boring haha
0,How have you been filling your time during quarantine?
0,Being a nanny plus class sounds like a lot haha - I struggled with class alone in college
0,"I grew up in new york state, but moved here from Boston"
0,Went to college in Providence... so I guess I'm coming from a lot of places
0,Cant say I've ever met someone who's been to Rhode Island but not New York hahahaha. Are you going to school in Oakland too or just at home right now?
0,"Yeah new york city is something you have to experience. There is really nowhere like it, at least in America. I would never want to live in there but it's fun for like two days hahaha"
0,"I live in Berkeley on mlk way, by ohlone park. I was actually between oakland and Berkeley when I was looking for somewhere to live but ended up here."
0,I've heard oakland really cool though
0,No worries I usually have them off too so I spend less time on this app hahaha
0,What sort of stuff do you like to do in Berkeley? With the quarantine and all I havent had much chance to explore
0,I suck at smash but what makes you think you stand a chance at jeopardy
0,Hahaha damn it you got with me the or. Either way I was bluffing you would probably wack me at both.
0,Are you a professional soccer coach?
0,That's a dope job. I was a grader in college which was an extremely exciting way to make 10 dollars an hour
0,"I'm assuming you are at Berkeley, what are you studying?"
0,"Psychology is really cool, are you gonna be a therapist or just doing it cause it's cool? Are you psychoanalyzing me as we speak"
0,"A combination of factors. I'm part of a couple communities that are centered here, it's good for.my line of work (software), the weather is great, and I wanted to try something new after spending my whole life in the northeast"
1,Dope so if we get married I can get free drugs in 10 years
0,I grew up in new york state in a town called Mamaroneck. Then my mom and I moved to Mass when I was in college and moved around there a bit.
0,I actually had never been to Ca before moving here. But I've liked it a lot so far minus the air quality
0,I have like no sense of smell so I only notice when I start coughing
0,Are you from CA?
0,"I miss the east coast a bit, especially the part where I paid 500 dollars a month in rent. Why a year in New Orleans - did you go somewhere else and then transfer? I would last like 2 days (ambitious estimate) in that climate before leaving so kudos to you for lasting so long"
0,"Believe it or not you are not the first Tulaner I've met on tinder haha. What I've heard about it corroborates what you said, my friend there goes three times a week despite coronavirus."
0,Are you big into partying?
0,Goes out *
0,"Same as you. Partied a decent amount in high school and early college, then for whatever reason being drunk didnt feel good anymore so that pretty much was it for me.  Was never going out 3 times a week tho haha I would literally die"
0,You ever do some crazy shit while drunk
0,That bad huh?
0,Now I'm curious
0,Might as well get all the embarrassing stuff out then it's all uphill from here
0,"Haha those are the important ones. But I also have a bunch of random interests. I like running and hiking, intellectual stuff generally like reading, coding, reality TV, political gambling recently, video games"
0,What are you into besides jeopardy and smash?
0,Also I just saw your 5th photo for the first time and it made me laugh really hard
1,I bet all your pictures do well with dudes 😎
0,I was a neuroscience major for one semester! Really cool stuff
0,Do you play soccer at Cal?
0,That's real smart. I've seen people really change after multiple concussions so I'm not letting my kids play football haha. How did it inspire your interest in neuroscience?
0,Oh man migraines are the worst. I had them pretty bad for a couple years. How often do you get them?
0,You should try magnesium and vitamin B2 if you haven't already. There is some decent research suggesting that they help
0,"CoQ 10 too if I remember correctly. Ironically my migraines ended up being caused by a magnesium supplement I took, and it was months before I found the connection because it didnt make any sense."
0,"I appreciate you asking. In general, not a really serious relationship (I spent most of college in one so I need some time off), but I guess you never know. Beyond that I'm pretty flexible in terms of what I'm looking for. With Corona things are bit weird. My house is really strict about social distancing, and the majority agreed on being this risk averse so I gotta respect it. Which makes things a bit challenging at least in the next couple months before we get this allegedly 90 percent effective vaccine."
0,How about you?
0,"I guess to be more succinct, generally I'm looking for somewhere between  friends with benefits and semi serious fling"
1,Currently looking more for friends with sexual tension hahaha
0,"Haha it doesn't to me. I'd say I'm not looking for a relationship, but am looking for some level of connection beyond hooking up and nothing else. Have you met many dudes off tinder or no?"
0,"I have met up with only two I think. The first girl was pretty cool, but our first date was a few days before we got off for winter break so that didn't continue. Then I had a fling with another girl who was pretty cool (the tulaner). Another girl who I had seen around campus and was really into asked me out on tinder and then flaked in a pretty shitty way."
0,So tinder has been like mildly fruitful haha
0,Probably not worth the countless hours I have wasted swiping
0,Hahaha this is over the course of like a year
0,"She asked me out, I gave a time like 9 or 10 days out. She did not respond until the night before when I was in NC for a job interview and asked me if I was still good for the date. And when I tried to reschedule she got pissed off. It was truly baffling"
0,Bullet dodged though
0,This is super unrelated but I'm curious how you spend your days with covid
0,I feel like my entire day kind of blends together cause I have nowhere to be and before I know it a full day has passed and it's not clear what I've really done
0,"Hahaha was the frat your only option? I would probably take anything over a frat. I lived in a sorority my sophomore year which was great, both for meeting girls and living in a clean and peaceful space."
0,What classes are you in right now?
0,I see. Is it an off campus frat house? Judging by my rent this might be the one part of the country where I'd guess that dorms are cheaper than off campus
0,What have you learned in your biological clocks class? I cant seem to get my circadian rhythm in check. Always feel tired when I want to be awake and vice versa
0,Okay what the fuck that is absurd. Our student housing was like 800 a month and that was enough to elicit my indignation. 2200 a month seems like probably not that far off tuition right?
0,I do not buy that taking melatonin is useless. I took it for a while and it was too effective. Knocked me straight out but then I'd feel really off the next day
0,Maybe I have a melatonin deficiency...
0,Yeah that's absurd. I guess they can get away with it cause the area is so expensive.
0,You doing anything interesting this weekend?
1,"Hey Sammy, you have a great smile!"
0,How is your life going right now 1-10 hit me with it
1,"Hey Madelyn, you have a great smile!"
0,What sort of art do you do?
0,It does not but now I am concerned why you think it does. Are there signs?!?!??!
0,I am just kidding I have a long and colorful family history of early onset balding and according to 23 and me I have every genetic risk factor
0,Thankfully I have a beautifully shaped head so I look forward to those days
0,In what ways have you been screwed by genetics
1,I have a fat ass too believe it or not. What if we had a kid
1,So will we conceive in your 2003 subaru or mine
0,Hey Grace what's up?
0,Can you tell me what FDT stands for I have been trying to figure this out for like 3 minutes and I'm dying to know
0,"Disappointed in myself for not figuring that out.  Share the sentiment though, the election was a huge relief though I wish it wasn't as close as it was"
0,If you had a bio what would it say
